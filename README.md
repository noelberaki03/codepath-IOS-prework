                 while on other apps.

2. Entertainment app: NBA
    * Feature 1: Notifications about my favorite team updates
    * Feature 2: Quick, real-time updates of NBA news
    * Feature 3: Provides pretty much any statistic I may be interested in, in a nice, clean UI.

3. Entertainment app: Instagram

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I unknowingly added constraints on some of the objects which messed with the layout.
Took me a little too long to realize where the bugs were.
